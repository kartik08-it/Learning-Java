# Java Operators
    Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
    In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

#   int x = 100 + 50;
    Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:

# + 	Addition 	Adds together two values 	x + y
# - 	Subtraction 	Subtracts one value from another 	x - y
# * 	Multiplication 	Multiplies two values 	x * y
# / 	Division 	Divides one value by another 	x / y
# % 	Modulus 	Returns the division remainder 	x % y
# ++ 	Increment 	Increases the value of a variable by 1 	++x
# -- 	Decrement 	Decreases the value of a variable by 1 	--x   


# Note: When dividing two integers in Java, the result will also be an integer. For example, 10 / 3 gives 3. If you want a decimal result, use double values, like 10.0 / 3.


Sometimes, you might both increment and decrement the same variable. Remember that if you increase a value and later decrease it, it will go up by one and then back down by one - ending up where it started:


# Assignment Operators
    Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x:
    addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:


    Operator 	Example 	Same As 
#       =    	x = 5   	x = 5 	
#       +=   	x += 3 	    x = x + 3 	
#       -= 	    x -= 3 	    x = x - 3 	
#       *=   	x *= 3   	x = x * 3 	
#       /=  	x /= 3  	x = x / 3 	
#       %= 	    x %= 3   	x = x % 3 	
#       &= 	    x &= 3 	    x = x & 3 	
#       |= 	    x |= 3 	    x = x | 3 	
#       ^=  	x ^= 3 	    x = x ^ 3 	
#       >>= 	x >>= 3 	x = x >> 3 	
#       <<= 	x <<= 3 	x = x << 3 	


Note: Most assignment operators are just shorter ways of writing code. For example, x += 5 is the same as x = x + 5, but shorter and often easier to read.
