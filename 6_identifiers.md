# Identifiers
    All Java variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.
    Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

# Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:

The general rules for naming variables are:

-    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
-    Names must begin with a letter
-    Names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace
-    Names can also begin with $ and _
-   Names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
-    Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names

# Invalid Identifiers

-   int 2ndNumber = 5;  // Cannot start with a digit
-   int my var = 10;    // Cannot contain spaces
-   int int = 20;       // Cannot use reserved keywords

# Java Data Types :- 
    int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
    float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // Floating point number
    char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
    boolean myBool = true;       // Boolean
    String myText = "Hello";     // String

# Primitive data types 
    includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char

# Non-primitive data types
    Such as String, Arrays and Classes
