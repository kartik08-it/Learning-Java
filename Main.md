# Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.

The class name should always start with an uppercase first letter.

to compile the code run the command-> javac Main.java   # compile
to execute the code  run the command -> java Main.java   #run

# Note: Java is case-sensitive. Main and main would be treated as two completely different names.

The name of the Java file must match the class name. So if your class is called Main, the file must be saved as Main.java. 
This is because Java uses the class name to find and run your code. If the names don't match,
Java will give an error and the program will not run.





# The main Method


# The main() method is required in every Java program. It is where the program starts running:
    public static void main(String[] args)


Any code placed inside the main() method will be executed.
till nowJust remember: main() is the starting point of every Java program.


# System.out.println()
Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:


# The curly braces {} mark the beginning and the end of a block of code.
System.out.println() may look long, but you can think of it as a single command that means: "Send this text to the screen."
