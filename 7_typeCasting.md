# Java Type Casting
    Type casting means converting one data type into another. For example, turning an int into a double.
    In Java, there are two main types of casting:

# Widening Casting (automatic) -
     converting a smaller type to a larger type size
        byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

# Narrowing Casting (manual)
    converting a larger type to a smaller type size
        double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte


# Real scnerio Based Example :- 
    We calculate the percentage of a user's score in relation to the maximum score in a game.
    We use type casting to make sure that the result is a floating-point value, rather than an integer:
#    (Line NO. 20 )
