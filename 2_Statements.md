# Statements :- 
    A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
The following statement "instructs" the compiler to print the text "Java is fun!" to the screen:

# example :-
    System.out.println("Java is fun!");   

    It is important that you end the statement with a semicolon ;.
    without ; you will see  error: ';' expected
