# variables :- 
Variables are containers for storing data values. 

- String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
- int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
- boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

# Declaring (Creating) Variables
To create a variable in Java, you need to:

-   Choose a type (like int or String)
-    Give the variable a name (like x, age, or name)
-    Optionally assign it a value using =

# String name = "John";
# int number = 100;

# int number;
# number = 100;
You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:


you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:
# String device = "Dell xps";
# device =  "Lenovo";



# Final Variables

If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, 
use the final keyword (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):
